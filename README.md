# XIVnamefinder

XIVnamefinder is a simple name finder tool for the popular MMORPG, Final Fantasy XIV. The tool generates a full list of canonized character names from the naming conventions of the game's various races and tribes, so that you can see all of the names that are present in the game's ‘randomizer’ system.

## Usage

To use this program, you should have Python installed on your computer. Once you have Python installed, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the program files are located.
3. Type `python main.py` and press Enter to run the program.

The program will then run and prompt you for any necessary input or parameters. Follow the instructions provided by the program to use it as intended.

Please note that XIVnamefinder is currently a work in progress, and there are a few tweaks that still need to be made. Specifically, the tool needs to remove duplicates and generate Lalafell names, as well as split Miqo'te names from their tribe names and remove duplicates from those results.

Additionally, XIVnamefinder only finds names that are canonized in the game, so you can be sure that all of the names generated by the tool are present in the game's randomizer.
